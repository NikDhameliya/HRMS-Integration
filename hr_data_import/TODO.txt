To handle the "day_transfer" leave type in Odoo, where you have start and end times on different days, you can create two leave records: one for the start date and one for the end date. This approach ensures that the leave entries reflect the correct hours and dates in the Odoo system.

Handling "day_transfer":

Extract start and end times from the detail dictionary.
Create separate leave records for start and end times.
Update leave values and details for both start and end parts of the day transfer.
